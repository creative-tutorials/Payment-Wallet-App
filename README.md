# Payment-Wallet-App

This is a mini project of all transaction app

In this repo I'll list the concept behind creating this app


<h3>#1 Login Authentication</h3>
<p>Like any other transaction app you will have to sign in before using their app, I used the submit event in JavaScript to submit the form once user has filled it correctly before that happend it JavaScript I first created my form in HTML</p>

<h3>#2 Retrieving and Storing Data</h3>
<p>Here I stored every data going on In this app let me explain, first I stored username into the database using LocalStorage, this way a welcome message will be displayed 
with the users name,</p>
</p>Second I stored every transaction data that was made, if user makes a transaction It gets stored Into JavaScript LocalStorage.</p>

<h3>The Actual Transaction</h3>
<p>Yes I sent a transaction but is it real, well no and yes no because you don't get the actual money, yes because the user will see that a transaction has being processed
into his account and you the transaction send has seen that I've send this transaction sucessfully.</p>

<p>All these were made using LocalStorage and some data collection<p>
